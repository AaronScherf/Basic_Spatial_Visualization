For this seminar, we will use a variety of different datasets concerned with bicycles, land cover, and census demographics for New York City. This data was chosen because NYC has a fantastic repository of open source data available for free online. The remaining data was downloaded from the Census Bureau website, particularly the American Factfinder, where both decennial Census data and American Community Survey (ACS) data is available free for download (see links above).

To follow along with this guide, [download the repository on GitHub here](https://github.com/AaronScherf/Stata_for_Policy_Analysts/tree/Tableau_QGIS_Only) as a .zip folder. Then unzip the folder to a destination on your hard drive. The folder should contain 3 files and 4 sub-folders in its main directory, with a variety of files in each sub-folder. The relevant files are described in the table above; other files, particularly for spatial data, are "support files" which help programs import the main file of interest.

### QGIS Environment {#qgis-environment}

QGIS has become the leading standard in open source spatial data software. Its primary functions are importing, manipulating, and visualizing geographic data, though it also has useful tools for connecting non-spatial data and performing simple analysis. It has a standard, photoshop-style user interface based on layers of data displayed in a visualization window, with a host of tools and settings in the bars at the top.

![alt_text](images/Intro-to0.png "image_tooltip")


There are many options for customizing the QGIS environment, but the main addition that I prefer is the "Manage Layers Toolbar". You can activate it in the View -> Toolbars dropdown.

### Spatial Vector Data {#spatial-vector-data}

The primary type of spatial data which you can work with is vector files. These are often traditional [shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), a designation created by [Esri ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri)(the folks behind ArcGIS), but can also include [Keyhole Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) (KML) and KMZ (zipped KML) file types. Fundamentally they are all collections of coordinates organized into shapes (points, lines, and polygons). These shapes are often coded with unique identifiers connected to numeric, text, or logical data variables. Shapefiles are almost always associated with a database support file, which QGIS can import with the geometry as an associated data table, much like a CSV file.

First, let's bring in a shapefile of all census block groups in the state of New York using the "Add Vector Layer" button in our Manage Layers Toolbar.



<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to2.png "image_tooltip")


This brings up the Data Source Manager opened to the Vector tab. You can browse for a vector dataset using the button with an ellipse "..." next to the filepath bar.



<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to3.png "image_tooltip")


After browsing to the "CBG_2017" folder, select the shapefile "cb_2017_36_bg_500k.shp". Note that shapefiles use the .shp file format, while the various support files associated with them can often include similar formats like .shx. Ensure that you select the type "SHP File".



<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to4.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to4.png "image_tooltip")


After you successfully import the shapefile you should see the state of New York, divided by census block groups, as below. The color is selected randomly so don't worry if it isn't yellow.



<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to5.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to5.png "image_tooltip")


If you want to see the data variables associated with the shapefile, you can open the browse window at the top right, clicking the button "Open Attribute Table", shortcut F6.



<p id="gdcalert7" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert8">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

### Basemaps using QuickMapServices Plugin {#basemaps-using-quickmapservices-plugin}

Most maps include some form of base layer, usually a map of political boundaries or satellite imagery. These can be tiresome to find and download online for your specific map extent. Programmers, being lazy, have thus developed packages to automatically download and import a base layer. These user created packages are maintained by volunteers and as such can be out of date for newer versions of QGIS, but most "stable builds" have a full suite of packages for baselayers. If you are using version 3.4 or below you should have access to the QuickMapServices (QMS) plugin, which hosts maps made by the [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) project, one of the largest open source mapping projects in the world.

To access the QMS plugin, click on the Plugins dropdown and then "Manage and Install Pluginsâ€¦" to open the Plugins window.



<p id="gdcalert8" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to7.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert9">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to7.png "image_tooltip")


Search for "QuickMapServices" in the top bar and install to your computer.



<p id="gdcalert9" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to8.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert10">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to8.png "image_tooltip")




<p id="gdcalert10" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to9.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert11">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to9.png "image_tooltip")


From there, to use the plugin just select the "Web" dropdown menu, then QuickMapServices, followed by OSM (the other map options are incomplete, possibly waiting on updates to the package--the price of open source software). I like the OSM Standard map.



<p id="gdcalert11" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to10.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert12">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to10.png "image_tooltip")




<p id="gdcalert12" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to11.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to11.png "image_tooltip")

### Spatial Coordinate Data {#spatial-coordinate-data}

Another important type of spatial data is coordinate points. These are also stored as vectors, technically, but we import them most often from delimited text files (CSV's). If your data already contains columns for latitude and longitude, QGIS will automatically treat it as spatial data and assign it to the proper coordinate points (as determined by your project's coordinate reference system).



<p id="gdcalert13" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to12.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert14">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to12.png "image_tooltip")


After clicking on "Add Delimited Text Layer", select the "NYC_Bike_Collisions.csv" file using the browse button (...) next to File Name.



<p id="gdcalert14" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to13.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert15">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to13.png "image_tooltip")




<p id="gdcalert15" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to14.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert16">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to14.png "image_tooltip")


Once you have selected the CSV, QGIS will automatically assign the LONGITUDE variable to the x-field and the LATITUDE variable to the y-field within Geometry definitions. The CRM should automatically choose your project coordinate reference, as set by the shapefile we imported earlier.



<p id="gdcalert16" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to15.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert17">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to15.png "image_tooltip")


Click "Add" and then "Close" if the window doesn't disappear automatically. You should see a whole lot of dots added to your map right around New York City, as below.



<p id="gdcalert17" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to16.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert18">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to16.png "image_tooltip")


Note that they appear over the census block group shapefile by default, as they are the top layer in the "Layers" window. You can click and drag layers to change their order.

To inspect the data attributes inside of our CSV file of coordinate points, you can open the Attribute Table with the button next to the abacus in the top right. For those Gen-Z's who don't know what an [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) is, it was basically the original machine learning app.



<p id="gdcalert18" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to17.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert19">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to17.png "image_tooltip")


The attribute table shows our data in a typical row-column format, with columns representing variables and rows observations. You see our lat-long coordinates as well as a host of data on reported bike accidents in New York City. We can use these attributes to select, filter, sort, and style our data on the map. You can also edit data directly in QGIS in the editor mode.

Our bike accidents are very dense and jumbled, not to mention an ugly brown color. Let's change them to visually represent the number of people involved in the accident, then filter out "minor" accidents that resulted in less than 2 persons injured. First, right click the layer and select the "Propertiesâ€¦" button.



<p id="gdcalert19" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to18.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert20">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to18.png "image_tooltip")


This opens the "Layer Properties" window for this layer, starting on the Symbology tab. Here you can adjust the size, color, shape, and other options that affect how your data appears in the map visualization. Select the dropdown bar that says "Single symbol".



<p id="gdcalert20" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to19.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert21">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to19.png "image_tooltip")


You'll find several options for representing your data, including special options for point data such as "Point displacement", "Point cluster", and "Heatmap". We'll choose "Categorized", since we want to color the data by a numeric variable with a small range of values. "Graduated" would work as well but we will see that Categorized works best for our data.



<p id="gdcalert21" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to20.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert22">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to20.png "image_tooltip")


In the Symbology window we now have the option to set the properties of our points by a variable in our CSV. Use the dropdown to choose "NUMBER.OF.PERSONS.INJURED". Note that it is formatted as text data, not numeric as we might expect. This would cause a problem with graduated colors, since text doesn't recognize numeric hierarchies (1 < 2 < 3).



<p id="gdcalert22" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to21.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert23">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to21.png "image_tooltip")


Once you've selected the variable, choose the Color ramp. I went with Grays, but there are a lot of options depending on your preference and other map elements. Grays may have been a mistake, however, since our OSM base layer uses gray for non-vegetative area in cities.



<p id="gdcalert23" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to22.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert24">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to22.png "image_tooltip")


If your data isn't automatically pulled in to the main Symbology window, click "Classify" at the bottom left. If you want to change variables you can "Delete all" of your colorings, or select individual values to delete. You should see a set of  numbers from 0 to 22, ordered alphabetically (since it is formatted as text data), plus an "NA" and a blank value. They should be colored on a white-black grayscale, with the first value alphabetically being 0 (numbers come before letters). Since we want to represent "worse" accidents as darker, we'll re-arrange our order and change the colors to fit our needs.



<p id="gdcalert24" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to23.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert25">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to23.png "image_tooltip")


Click and drag the 12 and 22 values to the bottom of your list, between 7 and NA. Then right click on the individual classification values and choose the "Change Color" dropdown.



<p id="gdcalert25" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to24.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert26">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to24.png "image_tooltip")




<p id="gdcalert26" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to25.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to25.png "image_tooltip")


This pulls up the "Change Symbol Color" window, with a color scale selector that will be familiar to anyone that has used image editing software like Photoshop, including an HTML notation. Let's make 12 and 22 sufficiently dark to reflect their ordering in our grayscale, using "OK" to apply the color change. Then, deselect NA and the blank values to hide them from our map. Hit "OK" in the Symbology window to apply changes and close the window.



<p id="gdcalert27" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to26.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to27.png "image_tooltip")


We still have a lot of points on our map, most of them with values of 0 or 1. Let's pretend we aren't interested in these values, since we want to investigate more serious bicycle accidents. You can deselect values directly in the layers window of the main interface by clicking on the dropdown arrow next to your layer and unchecking the box next to them. Deselect the 0 and 1 values.



<p id="gdcalert29" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to28.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to29.png "image_tooltip")


That's better but it still doesn't tell us much. Let's deselect our census block group shapefile to see the points overlaid directly on the OSM baselayer. Then zoom in on Manhattan.



<p id="gdcalert31" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to30.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to30.png "image_tooltip")


Much better! Now we can start to see some clustering of points. Reassuringly, they are also mostly situated on roads, rather than in the middle of water, so it seems our CRM's line up. The points look good close up but zoomed out they start to crowd together. What if we wanted to change the size of the coordinate point so that it scales with our map? Open the Symbology window again and click "Change" in the Symbol bar.



<p id="gdcalert32" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to31.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert33">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

In the Symbol Selector window, click on the "Unit" dropdown where it is currently set to "Millimeter". Change to "Points" and then adjust the Size to 5. You can also adjust the opacity--let's set it to 70%. Apply and close the window with "OK".

Not too bad, but again the gray of the base layermakes it somewhat difficult to see. Let's try another color. I like the Plasma color scale, just because it sounds cool.

### Importing Non-Spatial Data & Joining Data {#importing-non-spatial-data-&-joining-data}

One key feature of QGIS is its ability to import non-spatial data and join (merge or connect) it to spatial data layers. We can bring in a CSV file with no coordinates or geometry with the same "Add Delimited Text Layer" button as before.



<p id="gdcalert37" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to36.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert38">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to36.png "image_tooltip")


Let's select the "NYC_ACS_Data_Perc.csv" to bring in our census demographics data.



<p id="gdcalert38" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to37.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert39">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to37.png "image_tooltip")


This time make sure that "No geometry (attribute only table)" is selected under the Geometry definition options in the Data Source Manager window. Click "Add" and "Close".



<p id="gdcalert39" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to38.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert40">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to38.png "image_tooltip")


The map didn't change but you have a new layer. Let's join our ACS data to the census block group shapefile (make sure it is selected again, and deselect the bike collision data). Right click the layer and go to "Properties".



<p id="gdcalert40" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to39.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert41">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to39.png "image_tooltip")


Select the blue sideways triangle on the left of Layer Properties to open the Joins window.



<p id="gdcalert41" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to40.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert42">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to40.png "image_tooltip")


The critical thing with joining data is to ensure that you have a unique ID variable in both datasets with the same values. This links observations from both data sources so that the data matches up. You don't need perfect 1-1 matches. QGIS defaults to a "left-sided" join, in which the shapefile determines the observations and any matches are brought in from the "Join layer". Since there are no geometries associated with the "Join layer", as it's just a CSV with no coordinates, it won't bring in data for which there aren't observations in the shapefile.

Select the "NYC_ACS_Data_Perc" as the Join layer, then choose the "Join field" as "Id". This is the ID variable from our CSV. Then select AFFGEOID for the "Target field". This is our ID from the shapefile. Now just click "OK" and wait for the data join to complete.



<p id="gdcalert42" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to41.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert43">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to41.png "image_tooltip")


Now your census block group shapefile will have data from the ACS CSV layer available for your map visualization!

Jump over to the Symbology tab to change our census block group map colors. Let's make a pseudo-heatmap representing the percentage of each area responding as white.



<p id="gdcalert43" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to42.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert44">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to42.png "image_tooltip")


Use the style type dropdown to select the "Graduated" option.



<p id="gdcalert44" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to43.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert45">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to43.png "image_tooltip")


Note how the options changed from the coordinate points layer. No heatmap or point based options, but we have "Inverted polygons" and "2.5 D". Again these are more advanced, so let's stick with graduated color maps.

Select the "NYC_ACS_Data_Perc_Race_White_Perc" variable, which is formatted as a "double" or numeric variable. You can see that the name of the CSV file precedes the variables that were brought in from that layer, so you can tell them apart from the original shapefile variables.



<p id="gdcalert45" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to44.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert46">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Intro-to44.png "image_tooltip")


Choose a color ramp option. I went with white to red but feel free to try something different. In order to see the values that will eventually form your legend, you need to "Classify" them. You have several options with numeric variables on how to split the continuum of values. "Equal interval", "Quantile (Equal Count)", "Natural Breaks (Jenks)", "Standard Deviation", and "Pretty Breaks". I chose Quantiles for interpretability; since the "Classes" option is set to 5 it will automatically break the data values into quintiles.



<p id="gdcalert46" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to45.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to45.png "image_tooltip")


After selecting the Mode, hit Classify to see the values and colors associated with them in the Classes window.



<p id="gdcalert47" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to46.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to46.png "image_tooltip")


Hit OK to apply the changes and return to your map.

![alt_text](images/Intro-to47.png "image_tooltip")


Not bad, but the relatively small size of some census block groups is obscuring our data with the black border lines. Let's set them to transparent so we can visualize our fine grain data.

Return to our Symbology window and select the "Changeâ€¦" button next to "Symbol".



<p id="gdcalert49" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to48.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to48.png "image_tooltip")


There is a very subtle difference in QGIS between the "Fill" and "Simple fill" dropdown options in the Symbol Selector. Choose "Simple fill" to pull up the detailed menu of symbol properties, including the border or "Stroke color". It's currently set to black. Use the dropdown arrow on the right to pull up the quick style adjustor.



<p id="gdcalert50" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to49.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to49.png "image_tooltip")


At the top of the menu, choose "Transparent stroke".



<p id="gdcalert51" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to50.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to50.png "image_tooltip")


You will see the gray and white checkerboard pattern of transparent or "alpha" background in the "Stroke color" option.



<p id="gdcalert52" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to51.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to51.png "image_tooltip")


Hit OK to apply the changes and return to your map.



<p id="gdcalert53" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to52.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to52.png "image_tooltip")


Much better! Now we can visualize the percentage of white residents in each census block group at a good level of detail, even at this level of zoom. The red is a good constrast for the blue of the water. Let's bring our bicycle collision dots back onto our map view.



<p id="gdcalert54" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to53.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to53.png "image_tooltip")


Can you discern any patterns about the spatial relationship between bike accidents and concentration of white residents? If so, do you think it may be significant? It's hard to test hypotheses with just visualizations. You can do spatial analysis between layers to answer questions like these but those methods are beyond the scope of this simple introduction.

### Raster Image Data {#raster-image-data}

The final form of data we'll cover in this intro is raster files. These are basically image files with associated geometry, usually composed of satellite imagery. There is a whole lot of science behind satellite imaging but for our purposes we just need to know that raster images record light bouncing off the Earth into space. This light can be in the visible wavelength (like a Google Earth map) or in non-visible wavelengths (like infrared). Different wavelengths can be useful for identifying particular objects or "classes" of land (or water).

Our raster data uses an infrared wavelength to help identify various types of vegetation. To bring it into our map, click on the checkerboard "Add Raster Layer" button.



<p id="gdcalert55" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to54.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to54.png "image_tooltip")


This pulls up the Data Source Manager again, with two source type options: "File" or "Protocol". The latter is for online hosted data from a website or cloud server. The former is for files on your own machine, which is what we will choose.



<p id="gdcalert56" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to55.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to55.png "image_tooltip")


Use the browse button (...) to select the "landcover_2010_nyc_3ft" file from the "Sat_Image" folder. It's very important to select the "Disc Image File" type, not the Microsoft InfoPath file that also has the .img extension in the name. Raster layers, like shapefiles, often come with associated database files. Our file is the largest (118 KB or so), which is often the case. Raster files can be really large, particularly at finer resolutions.



<p id="gdcalert57" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to56.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to56.png "image_tooltip")


Click "Open" to bring the layer into the map. You'll see a really bizare image that looks like colorful TV static on a black background.



<p id="gdcalert58" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to57.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to57.png "image_tooltip")


This isn't an error. The infrared light has been separated into 15 values and each associated with a random color. 0 is for water or areas outside of the map, which is currently set as black. All of the other values are set at some random red, blue, green, etc.

To classify our vegetation satellite data in a more visually appealing way let's use a white-green color ramp. Go into the Symbology window and use the Color ramp drop down to select "Greens". You'll notice there is no option to select on variables, just "Band" values, which refer to the light spectrum represented in the raster data.



<p id="gdcalert59" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to58.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to58.png "image_tooltip")


To make our data represent "more green, more vegetation", use the "Invert Color Ramp" option.



<p id="gdcalert60" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to59.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to59.png "image_tooltip")


Now 0 should be the darkest green, with subsequent values fading to white. Since 0 is our water and blank data, let's change it to transparent. Right click to select "Change Opacityâ€¦"



<p id="gdcalert61" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to60.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to60.png "image_tooltip")


Set the opacity percentage to 0% and hit "OK".

![alt_text](images/Intro-to61.png "image_tooltip")


Now our raster data looks more like vegetation! Notice central park is more green than other areas. Yet intuition tells me that there is a lot of concrete in NYC that is currently styled as green in our raster layer.



<p id="gdcalert63" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to62.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to62.png "image_tooltip")


Go back to the Symbology window and set values 4 through 15 to transparent. You can select multiple layers by selecting 4, holding shift, and then selecting 15. Right click them and change the opacity to 0% again.



<p id="gdcalert64" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to63.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to63.png "image_tooltip")


Now we have a more convincing map of just vegetation. Zooming in on Central Park confirms our values--even the lake and walking paths are visible. The resolution of the raster is key here. Since we used 3 foot resolution, that means each pixel is a 3 foot square, allowing us to differentiate trees from the path or grass nearby. Less fine grain resolution can't do that, while finer grain can identify sections of individual trees!

### Exporting Maps {#exporting-maps}

Having a cool map in QGIS is fun, but most of us are interested in sharing our maps with others. For that you typically want to export your map as an image or PDF file rather than a QGIS file (unfortunately not everyone has QGIS readily available). Use the Project dropdown on the top left and select the Import/Export tab to select "Export Map to Imageâ€¦"



<p id="gdcalert69" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Intro-to68.png).

![alt_text](images/Intro-to68.png "image_tooltip")


This pulls up the "Save Map as Image" window with a lot of options on map extent, scale, resolution, and output dimensions. If you want a larger map or a higher resolution you can adjust these, but the default works well for us. You can also copy this image directly to the clipboard to paste it into a document or PowerPoint. Click "Save" to save the image file.

This pulls up the Print Layout Editor, which functions a lot like PhotoShop or Paint, with additional options to bring in our current map view, add legends, titles, shapes, and more!

Let's start by adding our map as the base of our print layout image.

Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert76">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

Click the scroll with a green plus sign on the left to "Add a new Map to the layout". Select the area on your print layout screen that you want the map to fit to. I used the entire expanse of the canvas.

Our map is brought in as an Item with plenty of associated settings on its location and appearance. As of now this is the same as exporting as an image, so let's add a legend.

We can designate the area for the legend on our map the same way we brought in the base map layer. You can adjust the legend items in the options dropdown menu on the right to select only the map items you care about. Here we only want the bike paths and collisions.

You can also add a title to your map and adjust the font using the text editor. Try out different options for yourself and see if you can recreate the map below!

Once you are happy with your Print Layout, use the Layout dropdown to "Export as Image" the same way we did before.

Viola, you have a beautiful map with a title and legend!
